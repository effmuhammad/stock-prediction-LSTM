# Stock Price Prediction with LSTM-RNN (ANTM-IDX Case)

In this notebook I try to analyze and predict ANTM stock price using deep learning algorithm LSTM-RNN. 
The data is fetched from Tradingview via tvdatafeed API with daily interval. Data start from January 2018 until August 2022.

The selection of data ranges is based on the occurrence of the covid-19 crisis, so I took data before the crisis, during the crisis, and after the crisis occurred.

Training data is carried out from January 2018 to July 2022 then predict future price for August 2022 (also compare it with actual data).

> **_NOTE:_**  
Price predictions from all machine learning cannot guarantee prices will follow their predictions, but with this prediction it can be a reference for traders to be able to make better decisions
